Outliner installation
=====================

1. Make sure you preserve the .mzp extension.
   Some browsers will automatically rename it to .zip or .rar! Unpacking this
   package manually is NOT necessary and running the installation script
   directly will cause it to FAIL.

2. Drag and drop the .mzp file from windows explorer into the 3dsmax viewport.

3. Click "install".

4. The installer will ask you if you want to assign opening and closing 
   the Outliner to the 'H' key. This is optional.
   
5. If you skipped step 4: assign the Outliner to a hotkey, menu item or 
   toolbar button through the Customize â†’ Customize User Interface menu 
   (select the category Outliner)
   
   
Upgrading
=========
If you are upgrading from an earlier version, you do not have to uninstall 
the previous version manually. This will be done automatically be the installer. 
Simply follow the installation steps 1-3. Preferences will be preserved for as 
much as possible.


Uninstalling
============
To uninstall, use the same procedure as for the installation. You can choose to 
preserve the preferences file when uninstalling. The installer used to remove 
the Outliner can be of a later version that the installed version. E.g. the 
installer for 2.0.9 can be used to uninstall 2.0.3. 
Any button or other UI assignments will have to be removed manually.
